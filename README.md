# Predicting-Life-Expectancy-Project

This project consists of an R Markdown file that walks through the analysis of public life 
expectancy data from [kaggle]kaggle.com. Descriptors of the model fitting process to final 
selection, as well as running diagnostics to check model selection are all included in the
.Rmd file. Data visualizations are includede throughout the report to support claims being
made about the data. An advanced and in-depth analysis of the final model is included at 
the end of the report.
